## Introduction

Originally this game started as a space invader-like game with enemies moving
down the screen as the player shoots them to collect points. But over the past
few months, this game has transformed into a bullet hell-like game where the
player must shoot enemies, collect exp to level up and gain skills, while 
traversing the desolate space to find companions to help them survive.

These companions attach to the player like snake appendages, each with their own
unqiue ability, such as shooting water at enemies. But the player must also 
protect these companions as they each have their own health.

Have fun and feel free to provide feedback and suggestions!

## Run Game

fun playing my game and achieving a new high score. The Game scene should be
